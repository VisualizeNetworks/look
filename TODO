* Add SNMPv3 support:
    This will require some research and extra processing by
    the looking glass server, but should work okay for most
    commands.  Not sure if ping or traceroute will work though.

* Add Quagga support:
    I'm thinking about having the software SSH to a machine and then
    run vtysh to get the commands.  We'll see how that plays out.

* IPv6 support:
    Should be pretty straight forward, I just need to test it in
    GNS3 to make sure I know what the pitfalls are.  This will
    also change some of the IP validation routines.
