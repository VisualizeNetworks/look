look - A PHP Looking Glass that supports Telnet and SSHv2.

------------
ABOUT
------------
look is a simple set of PHP scripts that can be installed on your network
and configured to connect to your routers and execute various commands.  At
this point, it supports connection to Cisco devices via Telnet and SSHv2.
SSHv2 is highly recommended.

------------
INSTALLATION
------------
1.  Install PHP, PECL, and the ssh2 PECL package.  The ssh2 package can be found here:

http://pecl.php.net/package/ssh2

2.  Copy all of look's files into a directory on your webserver.

3.  Edit the look-cfg.php and setup your environment.  If you're adding a lot of routers
that all are from the same vendor, use the same type of connection, and same authentication,
then set the "$DEFAULT_" variables first.  After that, add an array similar to the example
for each device you want to make available on the webpage.

4.  Test it out!
