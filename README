look - A PHP Looking Glass that supports Telnet and SSHv2.

Version 1.0 - 22 April 2012

-------------
ABOUT
-------------
look is a simple set of PHP scripts that can be installed on your network
and configured to connect to your routers and execute various commands.  At
this point, it supports connection to Cisco devices via Telnet and SSHv2.
SSHv2 is highly recommended.

-------------
INSTALLATION
-------------
1.  Install PHP, PECL, and the ssh2 PECL package.  The ssh2 package can be found here:

http://pecl.php.net/package/ssh2

2.  Copy all of look's files into a directory on your webserver.

3.  Copy the look-cfg-ini.php.sample file to look-cfg-ini.php.

4.  Edit the look-cfg.php and setup your environment.  Presumably you're going to setup
one username/password on all of your routers and use the same connection type to connect to
all of them.  Setup the default vendor, username, password, and connection values to
match your most common scenarios.  Then, add the individual routers at the end.

5.  Test it out!
